# Stock Control and Monitoring Project
Coursework implementation for the 340CT module.

Project was produced in C#.

As GUI development was not in the scope of the user stories, these were generated using Visual Studio.
All generated code is labeled as such in the source and is kept in separate files to mine.

XML was used rather than SQL as this felt more appropriate for a single table flat-file database. 

Implemented User Stories:

    -As a user, I must be able to add stock to the system, so that I can populate the stock database.
  
    -As a user, I must be view the stock in the system, so that I can find the status of each stock item.
  
    -As a user, I want to be able to view a stock report, to analyse the overall situation of the stock system.
